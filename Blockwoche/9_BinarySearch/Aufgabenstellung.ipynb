I know when I was starting out, some of my most common Python mistakes involved classic algorithms like this.\n","\n","This Python project for binary search takes in a sorted list (array), then continually compares a search value with the middle of the array.\n","\n","Depending on whether the search value is less than or greater than the middle value, the list is split (divide and conquer strategy) to reduce the search space, which hones in on the given search value. This continual division results in logarithmic time complexity.\n","\n","If you look at the code below, you’ll see that we’ve implemented two solutions: conditional loops and recursion. Both approaches are elegant, so feel free to experiment with each.\n","\n","If you’re new to recursion, this is a great introduction as it demonstrates how we ‘reduce’ the size of the problem with each recursive call, namely by splitting the list to one side of the current middle element.\n","\n","We’ve also defined the recursive base case as the point when the middle element equals the search element. In this case, the recursion will stop and return the True value up through the call stack.\n","\n","If this all sounds alien to you, consider using something like GitHub Copilot to make more sense of this classic algorithm.\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
